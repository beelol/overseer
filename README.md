# Overseer

A local agent orchestration daemon in Rust (`overseerd`) with a VS Code extension for
account-based agent runs, recursive native-child visibility, and live editable worktree
review built on [Branch Diff](https://github.com/beelol/branch-diff).

**Status: usable macOS milestone — not the complete product.** Verified acceptance
criteria: **46 / 53** · **2** partial (see [ledger](docs/verification/README.md)). Unverified:
AC-11, AC-13, AC-41, AC-50, AC-51, AC-52, AC-53. The biggest gaps are owner actions, not
code. Two criteria are partial, each with its proven part and the remaining step in
[Follow-ups](#follow-ups): a live ChatGPT re-sign-in (AC-11) and a live sign-in cycle of a
disposable ChatGPT account while another works (AC-13), both skipped by the owner for now.
Fixed Claude accounts (AC-53) wait for a second Claude account. Linux (AC-41) is out of scope for now; opening PRs (AC-50),
a worktree file tree (AC-51) and native Overseer-branded notifications (AC-52,
[design](docs/rfcs/native-notifications.md)) are future work. The full list is under [Acceptance criteria](#acceptance-criteria); next actions are in [Follow-ups](#follow-ups).

## Acceptance criteria

Checked means verified with evidence; each item links to its evidence record. The same
checkboxes appear in the [RFC](docs/overseer-rfc.md), which holds the full criterion text
and Verify clauses. Both lists are generated from the records by
`python3 docs/verification/records.py <commit>`, so they cannot disagree.

## What works today (macOS, VS Code 1.139)

- **Daemon** — SQLite state, owner-only Unix socket (versioned JSON-lines protocol), one
  supervisor process per harness run so work survives VS Code closing and daemon crashes;
  on restart the daemon reattaches or reports the session as lost, never relaunching work.
- **Harnesses** — Codex via `exec` and via the app-server transport (`codex-app`, with
  permission requests you Allow/Deny in the run panel) on a ChatGPT login; Claude Code on a
  claude.ai login (permission requests, nested subagents, follow-ups, interrupt); OpenCode
  through its real runtime (verified with a mock provider and local Ollama models); and any
  executable (generic). All live-verified on macOS except OpenCode account login. API keys
  are never forwarded to harnesses. See the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md).
- **Native children** — live child and grandchild capture for Claude Code, Codex
  (`codex-app` with `-c agents.max_depth=2`; default depth 1) and OpenCode, shown as a
  recursive tree with evidence and confidence; missing telemetry is shown as unknown.
- **Workspaces** — a new worktree per task by default, or the current checkout with its
  staged/unstaged/untracked/unsaved work recorded and preserved. Single writer per checkout;
  cleanup reports dirty files and active runs and never removes the current checkout.
- **Review** — Branch Diff's editable Monaco review opened on the selected run's worktree.
  Default comparison is **Latest run** (a snapshot taken at the start of every turn,
  including dirty and untracked files, without touching your index/stash); also since
  earlier turns, **Since task start**, **Original fork**, and any branch (merge-base or tip).
  A separate **Workspace Dirty** view always shows staged, unstaged, untracked, conflicted
  and unsaved work. **Follow** jumps to agent-reported edits across and within files and
  pauses when you scroll or select a file until you press **Resume**. Each hunk has
  **Accept** (marks it reviewed, no Git staging) and **Reject** (restores the comparison
  base through a native edit you can undo in the editor); concurrent agent edits are
  conflicts, never overwritten.
- **Conversation** — each run panel reads as a conversation: turns, collapsible tool calls
  with inputs and results, file edits that open the review at the hunk, inline permission
  requests, native children nested under the tool call that spawned them, errors (with
  **Sign in again** for expired logins) and per-turn usage; the raw event log is one tab away.
- **Overseer view** — **Open Overseer View** lays out an agents column (every repository,
  not just the open folder) beside the selected run's review and conversation; it works with
  the native sidebar closed.
- **Merge back** — never automatic: Overseer commits the worktree, merges the target into
  the run's branch in the worktree (conflicts go back to the same agent session), shows you
  exactly what lands, and merges into the target only after you confirm; a dirty target
  checkout is refused and left untouched.
- **Accounts** — accounts by provider (OpenAI/ChatGPT, Anthropic/Claude, OpenCode local);
  desktop-app logins are labeled as following the app; New Task offers only compatible
  accounts. Account login only, never API keys.
- **Session restore and background agents** — reviews, run panels, comparisons, Follow
  (paused), scroll positions and the Agents tree return after reloads and restarts. Closing
  VS Code with agents running posts a macOS notification naming them;
  **Stop Agents and Daemon** stops everything on request.

## Build and install (macOS)

Requirements: Rust 1.89+ (`cargo`), Node 24, Git, and the VS Code `code` CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beelol/overseer.git && cd overseer
npm ci --prefix extension/branch-diff/tooling/review --ignore-scripts
npm ci --prefix extension/tooling/vsce --ignore-scripts
node extension/scripts/package.js
code --install-extension extension/overseer-0.1.0.vsix
```

`package.js` builds the review bundle, builds `overseerd` in release mode
(`target/release/overseerd`; a few dead-code warnings are expected), copies it into the
extension as `bin/overseerd-darwin-arm64` (or your platform/arch), and writes the VSIX.
Reload VS Code; an **Overseer** (eye) icon appears in the activity bar. The extension starts
the daemon on demand (detached), so agents keep running after you close VS Code.

Run the checks:

```bash
cargo test
```

Packaged-UI scenarios (open a real, isolated VS Code window; see [test/ui](test/ui)). The
free ones use fixtures and mocks: `trust`, `main`, `review`, `restore`, `conversation`,
`hunks`, `accounts`, `signin`, `center`, `theme` and `perf` (10 minutes). Scenarios whose
header says LIVE spend a few tiny paid prompts.

```bash
node test/ui/scenario-main.js
```

## Using it

1. **Accounts**: **Add Account…** picks a provider and a name, then **Sign In** runs that
   provider's own login in a terminal (ChatGPT in the browser or with a device code). Existing
   desktop logins appear as accounts that follow the app. Overseer never asks for API keys
   and never signs out a desktop login; **Remove Account…** deletes only that account's folder.
2. **New Task…**: a form of tiles: repository (any repository, not only the open folder),
   harness with capability hints, a compatible signed-in account, *New worktree* or *Current
   checkout*, start branch, optional model and approval policy, and the prompt (⌘Enter
   starts). **Start Task with Quick Picks…** does the same with pickers.
3. **Open Overseer View** for the full-page layout, or use the Agents tree. Selecting a run
   opens its **Review** and its **conversation** with **Send follow-up**, **Interrupt**,
   permission **Allow/Deny**, **Raw output** and **Merge back…**. Controls a harness cannot
   support are disabled with the reason.
4. In the review, click the comparison label (base icon) to switch comparisons; use each
   hunk's **✓ Accept** / **↶ Reject**, or edit the working-tree side and **Save**. **Open in
   Native Diff** gives full editor features including undo/redo.
5. **Merge back…** when a run is done: prepare, review exactly what lands, confirm.
6. Agents keep running when VS Code closes (you get a notification). **Stop Agents and
   Daemon** (Agents view menu) stops them all after confirmation.

## Recovery

- State lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Overseer` (`overseer.sqlite`, per-run
  output under `runs/`, worktrees under `worktrees/`, profiles under `profiles/`). Linux
  uses `$XDG_DATA_HOME/overseer`. `OVERSEER_HOME` overrides it.
- The daemon binary is `target/release/overseerd` in a build, or
  `~/.vscode/extensions/beelol.overseer-0.1.0/bin/overseerd-darwin-arm64` once installed.
  `overseerd serve` runs it in the foreground without VS Code (the extension normally starts
  it detached). `overseerd ctl state` prints the daemon state; `overseerd ctl daemon.shutdown`
  stops the daemon (runs continue under their supervisors and are reattached next start).
- If a supervisor is killed, the run is marked `disconnected`/lost with the reason; nothing
  is relaunched automatically. Snapshot refs live under `refs/overseer/snapshots/*` in your
  repository and can be deleted with `git for-each-ref --format='%(refname)' refs/overseer | xargs -n1 git update-ref -d`.
- Worktrees are only removed by the explicit **Clean Up Worktree…** action (branch kept).

## Follow-ups

Unchecked criteria keep their AC in the [RFC](docs/overseer-rfc.md); this list only tracks
the owner action or decision each one needs.

- [ ] [AC-11](docs/verification/AC-11.md) (Account profiles): Skipped by the owner for now (2026-09-25: no sign-out cycles while agents are running). When revisited: sign a throwaway Overseer ChatGPT account in, Sign Out, and Sign In again through the UI (two browser logins). The Claude part is AC-53.
- [ ] [AC-13](docs/verification/AC-13.md) (Credential isolation on macOS): Skipped by the owner for now (2026-09-25: no sign-out cycles while agents are running). When revisited: sign a throwaway Overseer ChatGPT account in, then Sign Out and Sign In it again while ChatGPT B runs a task (two browser logins); Overseer checks that B and A are unchanged.
- [ ] [AC-41](docs/verification/AC-41.md) (Linux verification (deferred by owner)): Needs a Linux machine with VS Code and the harnesses. Next: run the README build, `cargo test`, and the UI scenarios there.
- [ ] [AC-50](docs/verification/AC-50.md) (Open a pull request from a run (coming soon)): Not blocked; deferred by the owner (coming soon). Next: use VS Code's `github` authentication session to push and create the PR.
- [ ] [AC-51](docs/verification/AC-51.md) (Worktree file hierarchy): Not blocked; not started. Next: a file tree for the selected run's worktree inside the Overseer view (AC-48).
- [ ] [AC-52](docs/verification/AC-52.md) (Native Overseer notifications (macOS)): Not blocked; not started. Next: a bundled `Overseer Notifier.app` (Swift, UNUserNotificationCenter, ad-hoc signed) used by overseerd with osascript as the fallback, a `vscode://beelol.overseer/open-center` URI handler, and an Overseer: Test Notification command.
- [ ] [AC-53](docs/verification/AC-53.md) (Fixed Claude accounts): Needs a second Claude account (the owner has one today). Next: Add Account → Anthropic → Sign In with it, Sign Out and Sign In again while a Claude run on the desktop login keeps working; confirm both identities and the macOS Keychain entries stay separate.
- [ ] Decide a retention policy for snapshot refs under `refs/overseer/snapshots/*` (they accumulate per turn; harmless but unbounded). Clearly labeled follow-up; no AC covers it.
- [ ] Decide whether the *existing login* Codex profile should be discouraged: on this machine `~/.codex` is shared with the ChatGPT desktop app and switched accounts during the session (see [AC-02](docs/verification/AC-02.md)). Clearly labeled follow-up.
- [ ] Remove or update the stale `~/Library/pnpm/codex` (0.1.x) on PATH; Overseer ignores it in favour of the ChatGPT.app bundle. Owner environment note.
- [ ] VS Code on this machine trusts `/` in its workspace-trust list, so folders never open in Restricted Mode; the trust test uses an empty window ([AC-08](docs/verification/AC-08.md)). Owner environment note.
